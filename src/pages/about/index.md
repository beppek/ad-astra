Dear reader,

I know you won't believe me, but I will tell my story anyway.

These messages are from the future. Yeah, that's what I said, you won't beleive me. But please, just shut off your critical thinking for a minute &mdash; how hard can that be? I mean, your time allowed Trump to become POTUS and the British people voted to leave the EU after all. Anyway, just say for the sake of it, that in the future we figure out that time is a lot more fluid than we thought. We haven't figured out how to send people back yet &mdash; at least not in my timeline &mdash; but we have figured out how to send information through time and space. The only problem is to find a receiver. Fortunately for me, I have found one and that is how you are able to read these messages through time and space.

The stories I tell you are real, they've all happened to me, Captain Rome of the Interstellaris. I can't promise that you receive the messages in chronological order, the receiver is not tuned to listen to messages from the future so I have to improvise. As a result I will try to keep my stories brief enough to fit in a single message, otherwise you might end up with the ending before the beginning. But don't get too confused if I mention something from the past in a message that you haven't yet read, it may still be in the future, unless you've just missed the message that is. Maybe you should go and check.
